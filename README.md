# RACLV2
RACLV2 is the improved version of our previous [RACL](https://github.com/gogo9211/RACL).

For a detailed writeup on the reversal and development process, read our thread on [v3rmillion](PLACEHOLDER_URL)!

Note: When injecting this, make sure that the DLL is injected into the **SECOND** process, and not the first.
